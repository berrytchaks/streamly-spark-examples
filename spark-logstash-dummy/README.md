# Streamly Lockstash Bridge Mock

This is a mock project that allows you to build a spark application  that has the capability to invoke logstash and stream messages to this logstash instance within the same Java Virtual Machine. The real implementation of this bridge is already deployed in the Streamly platform and is transparent to you.  As a result, you should import this project in your maven pom file with the provided scope. An example is depicted in this project: https://github.com/streamlyio/streamly-spark-examples/tree/master/streamly-kafka-cassandra-logstash.
